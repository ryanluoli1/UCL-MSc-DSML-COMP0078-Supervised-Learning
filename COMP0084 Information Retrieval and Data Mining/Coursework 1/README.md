# COMP0084 Coursework 1

In this project, we were asked to retrieve relevant **passages** from a collection when given a **query**.

We implemented the following:

- constructed the **inverted index**
- extracted the **TF-IDF** transformation
- built a simple **vector space retrieval model** based on **cosine similarity** using TF-IDF
- built a BM25 retrieval model
- built 3 **query likelihood language models** with different **smoothing methods**: Laplace, Lidstone, Dirichlet
