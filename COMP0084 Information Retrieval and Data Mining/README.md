## Course Contents

- Overview of the fields:

  - Study some basic concepts of information retrieval and data mining, such as relevance, association rules, and knowledge discovery
  - Understand the conceptual models of an information retrieval and knowledge discovery system

- Indexing and Text Processing:

    - Introduce various indexing techniques for textual information items, such as inverted indices, tokenization, stemming and stop words
    - Techniques used for text compression, such as the Lempel-ziv algorithm and Huffman Coding

- Retrieval Methods:

    - Study popular retrieval models (boolean, vector space, binary independence, language modelling) 
    - Probability ranking principle 
    - Other commonly-used techniques such as relevance feedback, pseudo relevance feedback, and query expansion

- Measurements:

    - Online and offline Evaluation techniques to evaluate retrieval quality. 
    - Commonly used evaluation metrics such as average precision, NDCG, etc. 
    - Cranfield Paradigm and TREC conferences, as well as some recently popular techniques such as interleaving

- Data Mining:

    - Study basic techniques, algorithms, and systems of data mining and analytics, including frequent pattern and correlation and association analysis
    - Basic machine learning algorithms such as linear regression and logistic regression
    - Discussion on basic personalisation and usage mining techniques
    
- Emergig Areas:

    - Study new emerging areas such as learning to rank, deep learning, word embeddings and topic modelling
