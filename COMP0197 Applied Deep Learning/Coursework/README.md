# COMP0197 Coursework 1

In this project, we trained and evaluated a [**ResNet50**](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet50) model on the **CIFAR-10** dataset with the task of **image classification**. We also implemented the [**mixup data augmentation**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412) technique for training with 2 different **sampling methods**.
