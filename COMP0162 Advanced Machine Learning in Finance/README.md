## Course Contents

This module aims to introduce advanced machine learning techniques for financial applications ranging from derivatives pricing, model calibration, portfolio allocation and hedging, credit scoring, fraud detection, investment decision, and risk-management. Text mining will also be introduced for the use of increasingly available alternative data sources.
